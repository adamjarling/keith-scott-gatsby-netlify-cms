This was to be my last music, fishing tour of 2019 to the Seattle Area. It almost didn't happen because my Moms furnace took a dive on the way to the airport but a last minute service call saved me!!!After a great late night flight I was at Sea Tac and on to some gigs and fishing .After a fantastic show in Seattle with fellow Bluesman and fisherman Brian Lee, it was on to Puget sound with my friend Julie Lynn and some educated cuthroat After 3 days I finally landed 3 one morning on a new secret method. Then it was on to the Olympic famous waters with my guide friend Steve Burns. We swung the Hoh, and The Clearwater and Bogashiel with only a few strikes ! But an adventure it was with Steve off roading in a Toyota 4x4. Happy New Year everyone and tight lines !! Keith
