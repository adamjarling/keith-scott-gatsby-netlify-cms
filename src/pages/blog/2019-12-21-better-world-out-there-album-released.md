We began recording this project at Nathan and Adam Arling's studio in the Logan Square neighborhood of Chicago. Some jams were just simple acoustic takes, and then Adam added the bass and I put on electric guitar and harmonica. The tracks were flown to Los Angeles where Nathan Arling and Josephine Forsman filled out the drums and percussion. We also had an additional session with everyone jamming, followed by an awesome Cuban feast at Chicago's hidden gem, 90 Miles Cuban cafe. The next step was to have our friend and guitarist in The Electric Blues Junkies, Tony McQuaid mix everything. Hope you like it! We say its blues from the depths of Chicago and the hills of Tennessee." - Keith
